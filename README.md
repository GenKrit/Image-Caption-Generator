Image Caption Generator Project README
Project Overview
This project is an Image Caption Generator that uses deep learning to generate textual descriptions for images. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an LSTM layer for sequence generation. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images and their corresponding captions.

Features
Extracts image features using a pre-trained Xception CNN.

Processes textual descriptions using tokenization, embedding, and sequence padding.

Combines image features and textual sequences to generate captions.

Implements an LSTM-based decoder for caption generation.

Saves trained models after each epoch for later use.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning models.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

PIL (Pillow): For image processing.

Matplotlib: For visualization.

tqdm: For progress bars during feature extraction.

Dataset: Flickr8k Dataset

Installation Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local system:

bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
Step 2: Set Up Environment
Create a Python virtual environment:

bash
python3 -m venv tf_env
source tf_env/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pillow matplotlib tqdm
Step 4: Download the Dataset
Download the Flickr8k dataset and place the following files in your project directory:

Flickr8k_Dataset: Contains images.

Flickr8k_Text: Contains captions.

Project Workflow
Phase 1: Preprocessing Text Data
Load captions from the Flickr8k.token.txt file.

Clean captions by:

Lowercasing text.

Removing punctuation and numbers.

Removing short or invalid words.

Save cleaned descriptions to descriptions.txt.

Phase 2: Extract Image Features
Load images from the Flickr8k_Dataset folder.

Extract features using the pre-trained Xception model.

Save extracted features to features.p.

Phase 3: Prepare Training Data
Load cleaned descriptions and extracted features.

Tokenize captions and create input-output pairs for training:

Input 1: Image feature vectors (2048-dimensional).

Input 2: Tokenized sequences of captions.

Output: Next word in the sequence.

Phase 4: Model Training
Define a model architecture combining CNN features and LSTM-based sequence processing:

CNN extracts image features (2048 → 256 nodes).

LSTM processes sequences of embedded caption tokens.

Dense layers merge both inputs and predict the next word in the sequence.

Train the model for multiple epochs, saving checkpoints after each epoch.

How to Run the Project
Step 1: Preprocess Text Data
Run the script to clean captions and save them to descriptions.txt:

bash
python main.py
Step 2: Extract Image Features
Run the feature extraction phase to generate features.p:

bash
python main.py
Step 3: Train the Model
Train the model using the prepared data:

bash
python main.py
The trained models will be saved in the models2 folder as model_0.h5, model_1.h5, etc.

Usage
Once training is complete, you can use the saved models for inference (caption generation) on new images. Load a trained model (model_X.h5) and pass an image through it to generate captions.

Important Notes
Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled for faster training (nvidia-smi can be used to monitor GPU usage).

Update paths in main.py according to your system setup:

python
dataset_text = "Flickr8k_Text"
dataset_images = "Flickr8k_Dataset"
The project uses dynamic memory growth for TensorFlow to avoid memory allocation issues.

Future Improvements
Add beam search for better caption generation during inference.

Expand dataset with more diverse images and captions.

Experiment with larger batch sizes or deeper architectures.
